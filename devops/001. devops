What DevOps Is:
DevOps = Development + Operations
It's not just a tool, it's a culture.

A collaborative approach where:
Developers
Testers
Operations
...all work together to deliver software faster and more reliably.

DevOps is:
A culture of collaboration and continuous feedback
A never-ending cycle of improvement
A technical Agile approach where everyone is expected to be hands-on and technical



Core DevOps Practices:

Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers frequently merge code to a shared repo
Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.

Continuous Development (CD)
Writing code in a continuous flow with minimal interruption

Continuous Testing
Automated tests run continuously to ensure code quality

Continuous Deployment
Code is automatically deployed to production after passing tests

Continuous Monitoring
Monitoring the application’s performance and availability in real time

all of these fall under the umbrella of DevOps.




Tools Used in DevOps (Toolchain Examples):

CI Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI
Build Tools: Maven, Gradle
Testing Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG
Deployment Tools: Docker, Kubernetes
Monitoring Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack


Traditional vs DevOps Workflow:

Phase	          Traditional SDLC	     DevOps
Development	    Separate Dev team	     Shared responsibility
Testing	Done    after dev	             Done alongside dev
Deployment	    Manual, by Ops	       Automated, frequent
Collaboration	  Siloed	               Cross-functional teams







How Does CI/CD Work for Production Code?

Here’s a typical flow:

1. Developer Pushes Code
Code is pushed to a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Usually to the main, master, or a release branch.
2. CI/CD Pipeline Is Triggered
The push triggers a pipeline (via tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.).
This is typically done via webhooks from the VCS to the CI/CD tool.
3. Stages in the Pipeline:
>Build Stage:
Code is compiled or packaged (e.g., .jar, .war, Docker image).
Artifacts are generated.
>Test Stage:
Unit Tests: Test individual components.
Integration Tests: Test how components interact.
Static Code Analysis: Linting, code quality, security scans.
End-to-End/Automation Tests (optional): UI or API tests.
>Staging/Pre-Prod Deployment:
Deploy the application to a staging environment to mimic production.
Run additional smoke tests or regression tests.
>Approval (in Continuous Delivery):
Human reviews results and approves for production deployment.
4.Production Deployment (CD)
>Code is deployed to production using tools like:
Docker/Kubernetes
Terraform/CloudFormation
AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps, etc.
>Deployment strategies might include:
Blue/Green Deployment
Canary Releases
Rolling Updates



What Is Tested Before Reaching Production?

| Stage              | Tests Performed                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Build              | Syntax checks, dependency resolution        |
| Unit Test          | Small, fast tests of isolated functions     |
| Integration Test   | Components working together                 |
| Linting            | Code style, formatting, basic errors        |
| Static Analysis    | Security vulnerabilities, code smells       |
| UI/API Tests       | Simulated user interactions (if configured) |
| Staging Deployment | Smoke tests, manual exploratory testing     |



How Does the Build Get Triggered?
Automatically:
On every push or merge to a specific branch (main, develop, etc.).
On a Pull Request being opened or updated.

Manually:
A user triggers the pipeline from the CI/CD UI (e.g., "Run pipeline" button).




Step-by-Step: Pushing Code from Dev to Staging
1. Merge dev into staging branch (Git side)
This is done manually or via Pull/Merge Request.

# Make sure you're on your local dev branch and it's up to date
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Switch to staging branch and merge dev into it
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git merge dev

# Push the updated staging branch to remote
git push origin staging

##Some teams create a Pull Request (PR) from dev to staging on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to review the changes first.





i asked more ques and i got my doubts cleared.


the code is deployed to staging via CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) — not directly via the merge request itself.

What Actually Deploys Code to Staging?
1. The merge request (MR/PR):
Only moves code from one branch to another, e.g., dev → staging.
It does not deploy the code.
It triggers deployment only if CI/CD is configured to respond to changes in the target branch (like staging).
2. CI (Continuous Integration):
CI builds the app and runs tests when code is pushed.
Ensures the code is clean, secure, and test-passing.
CI itself does not deploy — it just prepares and verifies the code.

CD (Continuous Delivery / Deployment):
>CD is what actually deploys code to the staging environment.
>It's automatically triggered when:
A branch like staging is updated (e.g., after a merge request is merged).
CI has passed successfully.
>The CD pipeline runs scripts or workflows that:
Create deployment artifacts (e.g., Docker image)
Push to staging servers, ECS, Kubernetes, EC2, etc.

Example Flow
Developer creates a PR from dev → staging.
The PR is reviewed and merged into the staging branch.
The push to staging triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
CI stage runs tests/builds.
If CI is successful, CD deploys the code to staging.
