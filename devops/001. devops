What DevOps Is:
DevOps = Development + Operations
It's not just a tool, it's a culture.

A collaborative approach where:
Developers
Testers
Operations
...all work together to deliver software faster and more reliably.

DevOps is:
A culture of collaboration and continuous feedback
A never-ending cycle of improvement
A technical Agile approach where everyone is expected to be hands-on and technical



Core DevOps Practices:

Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers frequently merge code to a shared repo
Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.

Continuous Development (CD)
Writing code in a continuous flow with minimal interruption

Continuous Testing
Automated tests run continuously to ensure code quality

Continuous Deployment
Code is automatically deployed to production after passing tests

Continuous Monitoring
Monitoring the applicationâ€™s performance and availability in real time

all of these fall under the umbrella of DevOps.




Tools Used in DevOps (Toolchain Examples):

CI Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI
Build Tools: Maven, Gradle
Testing Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG
Deployment Tools: Docker, Kubernetes
Monitoring Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack


Traditional vs DevOps Workflow:

Phase	          Traditional SDLC	     DevOps
Development	    Separate Dev team	     Shared responsibility
Testing	Done    after dev	             Done alongside dev
Deployment	    Manual, by Ops	       Automated, frequent
Collaboration	  Siloed	               Cross-functional teams
